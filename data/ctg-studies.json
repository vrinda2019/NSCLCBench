The treatment with TKI has become a new standard-of-care for patient with advanced lung cancer and EGFR or ALK changes. Several novel mutations, which are candidates as targets for specific medication have been discovered. Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2, erbB-2/neu) is a protein of the so called ErbB family (including HER2 \\[ErbB2\\], ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Mutations in HER2 are found in about 2% of the NSCLC.\n\nAfatinib works by blocking the activity of the ErbB family proteins and can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells. Afatinib is approved by the European and the Swiss Medicines Agencies for the treatment of adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung (non-small cell lung cancer) that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR as first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.\n\nA total of 22 patients from centers around Europe are expected to be enrolled in this study over a period of 24 months.\n\nAll patients will be treated in the same way.

In view of this bottleneck, further refinement of immunotyping and in-depth study of drug resistance mechanism are the most important tasks.\n\nRecently, studies have shown that the core elements of tumor microenvironment that have a significant impact on immunotherapy are:1. Infiltration abundance of specific killer T cells; 2. PD-L1 expression dependent on IFN - γ pathway, down-regulation of various active molecules and up-regulation of inhibitory molecules; 3. Activation and clearance of various inhibitory T cells.\n\nAlthough the classification has achieved further refinement of immune cells and molecular level, there are still some problems to be solved urgently: first, the classification of TIL cells needs further refinement, and different types of TIL infiltration have different guiding significance for prognosis; second, the subjective second-order semi quantitative scoring is often used for til count scoring, with low repeatability and different centers It is not easy for different pathologists to reach an agreement on the results of reading and interpretation. Thirdly, conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of tumor microenvironment analysis. In conclusion, it is urgent to develop a multi molecular marker landscape analysis system for tumor microenvironment, and establish a standardized detection process for each molecule to meet the needs of clinical positioning, quantitative and qualitative analysis for key molecular markers of immune microenvironment.\n\nIn this observational study, we evaluated the difference of gene mutation and immune microenvironment and therapeutic effect in primary NSCLC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["PD-L1","NSCLC","Biomarker","mIHC","immune microenvironment","mutation","sequencing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"FFPE tissue and whole blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation between specific gene mutation and immune microenvironment","description":"Correlation between specific gene mutation and immune microenvironment","timeFrame":"up to 1year"},{"measure":"Correlation between specific gene mutations and ORR and PFS in immunotherapy patients with lung cancerof lung cancer patients with immunotherapy","description":"Correlation between specific gene mutations and ORR and PFS in immunotherapy patients with lung cancer","timeFrame":"up to 1year"},{"measure":"Correlation between immune microenvironment and ORR and PFS in immunotherapy lung cancer patients","description":"Correlation between immune microenvironment and ORR and PFS in immunotherapy lung cancer patients","timeFrame":"up to 1year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation of OS with specific gene mutation in immunotherapy of lung cancer","description":"Correlation of OS with specific gene mutation in immunotherapy of lung cancer","timeFrame":"up to 1year"},{"measure":"Correlation between immune microenvironment and OS in immunotherapy lung cancer patients","description":"Correlation between immune microenvironment and OS in immunotherapy lung cancer patients","timeFrame":"up to 1year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Non small cell lung cancer was diagnosed by cytology or histopathology;\n* Patients to be treated with PD-1 / PD-L1 inhibitors;\n* Who signed the informed consent for participating in the research plan\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of other malignancies\n* Cancer meningitis in subjects\n* Incomplete clinical follow-up data\n* Failure to sign informed consent to participate in the research program","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Chinese","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"chengzhi zhou, PHD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+8613560351186","email":"doctorzcz@163.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Guangzhou","state":"Guangdong","zip":"510120","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Chengzhi Zhou, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+8613560351186896","email":"doctorzcz@163.com"},{"name":"Chengzhi Zhou, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":23.11667,"lon":113.25}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-12-09"}},"hasResults":false},

Especially in China, the burden of lung cancer has been rising rapidly due to its large and growing population. Histologically, approximately 85% of lung cancers are non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular targeted therapy has been shown to dramatically improve the quality of life and survival outcomes of NSCLC patients. One of the most important targeted drugs in NSCLC has been the epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), while there exists some other rare targetable mutation in NSCLC. Emerging evidence underlines that, rather than a single point mutation, some rare mutations present with a wide array of mutations, essentially in NSCLC.\n\nDifferent rare mutations with NSCLC have divergent clinical and therapeutic implications with a particular distinction. Therefore, there is an unmet need for more effective therapies for NSCLC with rare mutations. In summary, identification of genetic alterations in NSCLC with rare mutations is increasingly essential to perform molecular diagnostics and individualized treatments. This project aims to create a registry of patients with NSCLC with rare mutations to further the characterization of molecular alterations and develop (novel) treatments based on the detection."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC","NSCLC Stage IV","NSCLC, Recurrent"],"keywords":["NSCLC","rare mutations","molecular landscape","next-generation sequencing (NGS)","targeted therapy","immunotherapy","chemotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective response rate (ORR)","description":"Collect detailed clinical information on patients with NSCLC with rare mutations via the electronic medical records","timeFrame":"20 years"},{"measure":"Disease control rate (DCR)","description":"Collect detailed clinical information on patients with NSCLC with rare mutations via the electronic medical records","timeFrame":"20 years"},{"measure":"Progression-free survival (PFS)","description":"Collect detailed clinical information on patients with NSCLC with rare mutations via the electronic medical records","timeFrame":"20 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"Collect detailed clinical information on patients with NSCLC with rare mutations via the electronic medical records","timeFrame":"20 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically proven diagnosis of NSCLC with rare mutations including EGFR rare mutations, ALK fusion, ROS1 fusion, BRAF V600E, cMET exon 14 skipping, KRAS G12C, RET fusion, NTRK fusion, etc.\n* 18 years of age or older\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Participants with NSCLC with rare mutations are with the standard treatment and/or are enrolled in the clinical trials.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Xiaomin Niu","role":"CONTACT","phone":"021-22200000","email":"ar_tey@hotmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Xiaomin Niu","affiliation":"Shanghai Chest Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Xiaomin Niu","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Shanghai","state":"Shanghai Municipality","zip":"200030","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Xiaomin Niu","role":"CONTACT","phone":"021-22200000","email":"ar_tey@hotmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":31.22222,"lon":121.45806}},{"facility":"Xiaomin Niu","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Shanghai","state":"Shanghai Municipality","zip":"200030","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Xiaomin Niu","role":"CONTACT","phone":"86 21 2220 0000","phoneExt":"3708","email":"ar_tey@hotmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":31.22222,"lon":121.45806}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-12-09"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D002289","term":"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung"},{"id":"D012008","term":"Recurrence"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D002283","term":"Carcinoma, Bronchogenic"},{"id":"D001984","term":"Bronchial Neoplasms"},{"id":"D008175","term":"Lung Neoplasms"},{"id":"D012142","term":"Respiratory Tract Neoplasms"},{"id":"D013899","term":"Thoracic Neoplasms"},{"id":"D009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D008171","term":"Lung Diseases"},{"id":"D012140","term":"Respiratory Tract Diseases"},{"id":"D020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"},{"id":"D013568","term":"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms"}]}},"hasResults":false},

The prognosis is poor for patients presenting with brain or leptomeningeal metastases at any stage, particularly those with such metastases at initial diagnosis, who have the worst prognosis. Furmonertinib, as a novel EGFR-TKI, enhances its lipophilicity by incorporating a trifluoroethoxy pyridine group. Preclinical animal studies further confirm that both Furmonertinib (AST2818) and its metabolite (AST5902) exhibit excellent intracranial distribution. This provides strong theoretical support for the effective treatment of lung cancer brain metastasis patients with Furmonertinib.\n\nEGFR TKI-based combination therapies, as a strategy to delay disease progression, have consistently been a focal point in medical research. Among these, antiangiogenic agents are increasingly recognized for their synergistic effects when combined with TKIs, jointly inhibiting tumor growth, proliferation, and metastasis.Such combinations have demonstrated clear efficacy and manageable safety profiles.\n\nBased on this, the current study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment with 160 mg Furmonertinib combined with anlotinib for advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations and brain metastases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["NSCLC","EGFR"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":146,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"furmonertinib combined with anlotinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"furmonertinib combined with anlotinib","interventionNames":["Drug: furmonertinib combined with anlotinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"furmonertinib combined with anlotinib","description":"furmonertinib: 160 mg po qd Anlotinib: 8 mg per day, orally administered.The treatment cycle is every 3 weeks, with each cycle lasting 21 days.

One of its tasks is to control gene expression. Cells intake calcium from their surroundings though special calcium channels located on the surface membranes of the cells.\n\nThe great many studies on such calcium channels were performed on excitable cells such as muscle, heart or neuronal cells, where the calcium ions are controlled by voltage. Surprisingly, not much is known about the identity of calcium subunits in non-excitable cells like epithelial cells (which compose most of the connective tissue in the body), liver cells, lung cells, immune system cells, etc.\n\nRecently, the investigators have shown that calcium channels from muscles are, in fact, expressed in T cells of the immune system, where they are used for proliferation. The investigators postulated that probably other cell types, especially cancerous cell types, might be using these subunits similarly.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the identity and sequence of calcium subunits expressed in non-small cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC), which accounts for 80% of the worldwide lung cancer deaths.","detailedDescription":"Initial examination of NSCLC cell lines determined that they express the mRNA of voltage gated calcium subunits, found normally in neurons. Furthermore sequence analysis of these subunits has shown that modifications have occurred.\n\nThe aim of the study in NSCLC patients is to sequence and clone the calcium channel subunits expressed in their tumor.

From these images, the time during treatment where a 50% reduction in FDG uptake relative to day 1 is reached (T50) will be derived. The T50 of progression-free surviving patients will be compared with that of relapsed or deceased patients, in order to find a value that predicts early treatment failure. An additional FDG PET/CT scan at the same day as regular follow up CT scan will be made, two months after treatment, to have a baseline after treatment for follow up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["NSCLC","CCRT","FDG PET/CT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low dose FDG PET/CT 5x","type":"OTHER","description":"Stage II/III NSCLC will undergo a Low dose FDG PET/CT 5x during treatment (CCRT).","interventionNames":["Other: Low dose FDG PET/CT 5 x."]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Low dose FDG PET/CT 5 x.","description":"Multiple FDG PET/CT studies will be added to the normal diagnostic procedures as a part of this study, with the number of scans depending on the study stage, to a maximum of 6 per patient.","armGroupLabels":["Low dose FDG PET/CT 5x"],"otherNames":["No treatment intervention but diagnostic intervention."]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"maximum FDG uptake (SUVmax)","description":"• A main study parameter is the maximum FDG uptake (SUVmax (maximum Standardized Uptake Value)) at the location of the primary tumour, as determined at multiple days during treatment (with a maximum of five time points per patient), expressed as T50 for response evaluation.","timeFrame":"1 Year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"SUVmax during the first two weeks of treatment, indicating inflammatory response.","description":"• Increase SUVmax during the first two weeks of treatment, indicating inflammatory response.","timeFrame":"First Two weeks of treatment"},{"measure":"SUVmax in the two weeks prior to treatment, indicating progression","description":"• Increase SUVmax between diagnostic imaging and start of treatment, indicating potential progression.","timeFrame":"Two weeks prior to treatment"},{"measure":"Progression free survival","description":"• Secondary study endpoint is progression free survival, to be associated with T50 for prognostic value.","timeFrame":"1 Year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cytologically or histologically proven NSCLC\n* T2-4 N0-3 M0 disease (stage II or III, inoperable)\n* Scheduled for standard concurrent chemoradiation\n* Primary tumour minimal diameter 3 cm\n* Primary tumour SUVmax \\> 5 on routine diagnostic pre-treatment FDG (Fludeoxyglucose) PET/CT\n* WHO performance 0-1\n* Written informed consent according to GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and national regulations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\< 18 years, incapacitated subjects\n* Pregnant or lactating women\n* Diabetes mellitus requiring medication\n* Participation in dose escalation studies\n* Other neoplasms in the last 3 years, with metastases","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Wouter Vogel, MD,PhD","affiliation":"NKI","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"The Netherlands Cancer Institute","city":"Amsterdam","state":"North Holland","zip":"1066CX","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.37403,"lon":4.88969}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-12-09"}},"hasResults":false},

The AFT-16 trial of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in this setting provided proof of concept for safety of the neoadjuvant approach and for outcomes that compare favorably with standard of care therapy. The field of lung cancer immunotherapy is evolving rapidly and since the start of AFT-16 not only has adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab become standard of care, but combination immunotherapy with tiragolumab and atezolizumab for NSCLC has received breakthrough therapy designation. Safety of combination immunotherapy and radiation has been established in several trials, but the safety and efficacy of dual immunotherapy is not yet known. In a group of patients who can be but often are not cured with current therapies, establishment of a strategy that could increase cure rate is urgent. This randomized phase II trial can be advocated to determine the best of the two arms for further study with slightly inflated type I error rate"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":178,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A: Atezolizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"79 participants will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A.

Research showed that there are many gene mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and some activating mutations have become the hotspots in target therapy area. With the development of targeted drug research, the molecular classification of NSCLC will be more and more important. But a large number of clinical data showed that gene mutation in Chinese NSCLC patients is significantly different from Caucasian population, which suggesting that it is necessary to identify gene mutation profile in Chinese patients with NSCLC.\n\nSix hundred NSCLC paraffin tissue samples was collected during operation from Tianjin Cancer hospital in 2009-2012, which including lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.

However, the problem for clinicians is that not all patients with positive findings respond to this form of therapy.\n\nCell-free DNA (cf-DNA) can be detected in blood plasma. Tumor cells almost always have chromosomal instabilities (or \"copy-number variations\" (CNV)), which can be detected using next-generation sequencing (NGS), also in the cf-DNA. These CNV can be quantified and given as a cf-DNA copy number instability score (CNI value). TheraSure CNI-Monitor is a highly sensitive method that can detect as little as 0.5% tumor DNA in plasma.\n\nIn preliminary work in a cohort of 56 patients with various types of cancer (including: breast, colon, lung, ovary, melanoma) in advanced stages, the TheraSure CNI monitor was already evaluated in the monitoring of immunotherapy. In 51 of the 56 patients, increased CKD values were measured before the start of therapy compared to a normal group of 126 individuals. To predict the success of the therapy, further blood samples were used after the first and second therapy cycle and threshold values were set for the minimal expected decrease in the CNI value in the event of therapy response. A therapy failure could be predicted with a high positive predictive value, cases of hyperprogression could be detected earlier than by routine imaging. In addition, pseudoprogression could be distinguished from true progression using the CNI value.\n\nThe CNI monitor on cell-free DNA is to be used prospectively in 170 patients.

The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nAfatinib is active in patients with advanced NSCLC harbouring EGFR PACC mutation subtype.\n\nParticipants will undergo screening, follow by treatment if eligible for study participation and then enter follow up phase after study medication has stopped. Patients will take afatinib 40mg daily continuously, until the development of progressive disease or meeting discontinuation criteria. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days.","detailedDescription":"This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II study of patients with stage IIIb-IV NSCLC harbouring EGFR PACC mutations.\n\nBefore taking the study drug, patients will need to undergo baseline assessments to ensure that they are eligible for the study. Then they will enter treatment period, where afatinib 40mg will be administered daily continuously, until the development of progressive disease or meeting discontinuation criteria. A discontinuation visit will be performed if patients stopped study drug for any reason. Thereafter, patients will be placed on Follow Up visit.\n\nClinical assessment, routine blood tests and routine imaging:\n\nPhysical examinations, imaging, and blood tests will be performed during baseline assessment, on the first day of each treatment cycle, after patients have completed the study and when clinically required by the treating physician. Patients will need to visit the doctor's office approximately 1-2 times every 4 weeks when they are receiving active treatment during the course of the study. More frequent visits may be needed as clinically indicated by the treating physician.\n\nTreatment procedure:\n\nAfatinib will be taken once a day at approximately the same time each day initially starting at a dose of 40mg. Afatinib must be taken on an empty stomach (at least one hour before or at least two hours after a meal).\n\nResearch Blood samples:\n\nBlood samples for research will be taken at baseline, before starting cycle 3 and at the time of cancer progression. The estimated total volume of research blood that will be drawn is 10mL (2-3 teaspoons) each time for a total of 30mL."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["Afatinib","PACC mutation","EGFR mutations"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Afatinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Afatinib given as monotherapy daily in a 28-days cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: Afatinib 40 MG"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Afatinib 40 MG","description":"Afatinib 40mg administered orally daily.","armGroupLabels":["Afatinib"],"otherNames":["Gilotrif"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective response rate","description":"Defined as best overall response (Complete Response or Partial Response) across all assessment time-points according to RECIST criteria v1.1","timeFrame":"At baseline and every 8 weeks for the first 6 cycles, every 12 weeks from cycle 7 to 12 and every 16 weeks from cycle 13 onwards (each cycle is 28 days)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression free survival","description":"Defined as the time from the date of study enrolment to the first date of documented disease progression","timeFrame":"within 4 weeks from starting treatment and every 8 weeks for the first 6 cycles, every 12 weeks from cycle 7 to 12 and every 16 weeks from cycle 13 onwards (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Overall survival","description":"Defined as the time from the date of randomisation until documented progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death","timeFrame":"48 months"},{"measure":"Duration of response","description":"Defined as the time from first documented Complete Response or Partial Response to the time of radiological progression or death, whichever occurs earlier.","timeFrame":"every 8 weeks for the first 6 cycles, every 12 weeks from cycle 7 to 12 and every 16 weeks from cycle 13 onwards (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Time to treatment failure","description":"Defined as the time from afatinib treatment to the time of treatment discontinuation for any reason including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death","timeFrame":"48 months"},{"measure":"Number of participant with treatment related toxicities","description":"Toxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) toxicity grading Version 5","timeFrame":"48 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

This study will be conducted in two parts. Phase 1 is designed to observe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of poziotinib when administered once daily or twice daily. Phase 2 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the dose determined in Phase 1. Study participation includes a 30 day screening period, up to 24 months of treatment, and long-term follow-up for a maximum of 24 months after discontinuation of study treatment.\n\nPhase 1 will enroll up to 36 patients into a dose finding study with two parallel, randomized dose groups. Each group will undergo a dose-finding scheme using a 3+3 design with the assessment of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at up to three dose levels. Patients will be randomized into once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) dose groups. The DLT assessment will be conducted in the first cycle of treatment and therefore, poziotinib dose modifications are not permitted during this cycle. Patients will be hospitalized for the first 2 weeks.\n\nPhase 2 will enroll 40 additional NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (20 patients) or human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) (20 patients) exon 20 insertion mutations. Efficacy and safety of the dose and dosing regimen determined in Phase 1 will be evaluated.

There is still no clear evidence that the postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or other treatments can improve the survival rate for patients with stage Ib NSCLC. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) such as Gefitinib and Erlotinib are widely accepted as the first-line therapy for Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation late stage NSCLC patients. However the effect is largely uncertain for early stage patients who received surgery. The investigators aim to evaluate the effect of postoperative adjuvant use of Gefitinib for high risk stage Ib EGFR sensitive mutation NSCLC patients.","detailedDescription":"Currently, whether adjuvant therapy should be applied to Stage Ib non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received radical resection remains controversial. CALGB9633 studies have shown that for patients with stage Ib NSCLC who received radical resection, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy does not benefit for all patients, only patients with high risk (cancer diameter \\>4cm) can benefit. There is still no clear evidence that the postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or other treatments can improve the survival rate for patients with stage Ib NSCLC.\n\nThe EGFR gene mutation rate is about 10% for European patients, and about 30-40% for patients of Asian origins. In a retrospective observation study of 1118 stage I to stage III NSCLC patients who received surgery, D'Angelo et al. found that the risk of death for patients with EGFR sensitive mutation is lower than those without mutation. The authors indicated that postoperative use of TKI for EGFR sensitive mutation patients might be the possible reason. Since the mutation rate of EGRF gene is higher in Asian patients, compared with patients of other origins, the investigators speculate that Asian patients might benefit for postoperative use of TKIs.\n\nEGFR gene mutation detection is routinely prescribed nowadays for lung adenocarcinoma patients who received surgical resection. According to NCCN guideline, stage IB patients with high risk factors are recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients who can not tolerate or decline chemotherapy, non-specific treatment ( Chinese herbal medicine and nonspecific immunomodulators as adjuvant anti-cancer treatment for 2 years) is recommended, otherwise, TKIs（Gefitinib 250 mg daily for 2 years) is also an alternative choice if the cancer has EGFR sensitive mutation. Based on patient's own choice of postoperative adjuvant therapy , the patients were enrolled for observation of prognosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["Gefitinib","NSCLC","postoperative","stage Ib","Relapse Free Survival in 2 years"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gefitinib","description":"Stage IB NSCLC Patients with high risk factors and EGFR gene sensitive mutation who can not tolerate or decline chemotherapy and choose Gefitinib for postoperative therapy (Gefitinib 250 mg daily for 2 years)."},{"label":"Non-specific treatment","description":"Stage IB NSCLC Patients with high risk factors and EGFR gene sensitive mutation who can not tolerate or decline chemotherapy and choose Non-specific treatment.(Chinese herbal medicine and nonspecific immunomodulators as adjuvant anti-cancer treatment for 2 years)."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relapse Free Survival in 2 years","timeFrame":"Treatment period: 2 years (24 months)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Relapse Free Survival in 3 years","timeFrame":"Follow-up: 3 years"},{"measure":"5 year Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Follow-up: 5 years"},{"measure":"Relapse Free Survival in 5 years","timeFrame":"Follow-up: 5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

The study enables investigation of the efficacy of dacomitinib followed by or subsequent to osimertinib osimertinib in patients with classical or uncommon activating EGFR mutations. Efficacy of dacomitinib will be defined in patients with asymptomatic or controlled brain metastases, special population eligible in this clinical trial.","detailedDescription":"NSCLC remains the leading cause of cancer death in Western Countries. Lung adenocarcinoma has been extensively investigated and during the last 10 years several molecular events, including mutations, gene copy number alterations and translocations have been discovered, leading to a dramatic change in patient treatment. This is the case of EGFR mutant NSCLC in which drugs targeting the EGFR, such as gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib, have demonstrated superiority versus standard chemotherapy. Osimertinib, (AZD9291, Tagrisso, AstraZeneca) is a third-generation EGFRTKI which irreversibly and specifically targets both sensitizing and the resistant T790M-mutated EGFRs. It has shown greater efficacy against EGFR T790M mutation than the standard platinum plus pemetrexed therapy and was thus recently fully approved by the FDA for metastatic EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC1. More recently, the large phase III FLAURA study, comparing osimertinib versus the first-generation EGFR-TKIs gefitinib or erlotinib, demonstrated the superiority of osimertinib in terms of progression-free survival (PFS; median PFS 18.9 months versus 10.2 months; HR: 0.46; p\\<0.0001)2. Based on this result, in October 2017, the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for osimertinib for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In addition, the FLAURA trial clearly established the superiority of osimertinib even in special populations, including individuals with brain metastases. Due to these results, international consensus confirms osimertinib to be the standard of care as first-line therapy for NSCLC patients with EGFR M+ and as second-line therapy in patients with clinically relevant progression and confirmed T790M+. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804, Pfizer) is a second-generation, irreversible EGFRTKI, that has shown efficacy in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. Preclinical data showed that the drug is more potent than first-generation EGFR-TKIs, thus leading to comparative studies. The phase III ARCHER 1050 trial compared first-line dacomitinib versus gefitinib in patients with EGFR Del19 or L858R mutation-positive NSCLC. The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a PFS improvement in favor of dacomitinib, (median PFS 14.7 months versus 9.2 months; HR: 0.59; p\\<0.0001) and, most importantly, it significantly prolonged OS (median OS 34.1 months versus 26.8 months; HR: 0.76; p=0.048). The most frequent adverse events (AEs) with dacomitinib were diarrhea, skin rash and stomatitis, requiring dose reduction in more than 60% of patients3. Importantly, patients with brain metastases were excluded precluding any conclusion on dacomitinib efficacy in this clinically relevant subgroup. Even with such limitations, indirect comparison with FLAURA showed that PFS was similar to that obtained with osimertinib, particularly in the Asian population, raising the question on the optimal sequencing of drugs. Data from different phase III studies suggested that median PFS with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs followed by osimertinib could be superior to the current standard of care, which is osimertinib followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. An important consideration is that only a fraction of patients receiving first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs are eligible for osimertinib, because EGFR-T790M mutation occurs in up to 50% of cases. Therefore, at present, platinum-based chemotherapy is the only available option for EGFR-T790M negative patients. This algorithm is supported by the lack of efficacy of immunotherapy in presence of EGFR mutations, even if no study so far has been specifically conducted in patients progressing to first-line EGFRTKIs.\n\nOptimised EGFR TKI sequencing might be the most critical determinant of OS in patients with activating EGFR mutations. Data on OS will help to understand the best sequence for each individual patient. Based on these premises, there is a strong rationale for conducting a trial exploring the best EGFR-TKI sequencing (i.e., that to achieve optimal clinical outcomes) in advanced or metastatic NSCLC individuals with EGFR mutations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, non-comparative study investigating two EGFR-TKI sequences","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":170,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A (Osimertinib->Dacomitinib)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Osimertinib 80 mg/day until progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.\n\nAt treatment discontinuation patients maintaining the original EGFR mutation will switch to Dacomitinib 45 mg/day until progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.","interventionNames":["Drug: Osimertinib","Drug: Dacomitinib"]},{"label":"Arm B (Dacomitinib->Osimertinib)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dacomitinib 45 mg/day until progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.\n\nAt treatment discontinuation, patients harboring the EGFR-T790M will receive Osimertinib 80 mg/day until progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.","interventionNames":["Drug: Osimertinib","Drug: Dacomitinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Osimertinib","description":"TAGRISSO 40 mg film-coated tablets TAGRISSO 80 mg film-coated tablets","armGroupLabels":["Arm A (Osimertinib->Dacomitinib)","Arm B (Dacomitinib->Osimertinib)"],"otherNames":["Tagrisso"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dacomitinib","description":"Vizimpro 15 mg film-coated tablets Vizimpro 30 mg film-coated tablets Vizimpro 45 mg film-coated tablets","armGroupLabels":["Arm A (Osimertinib->Dacomitinib)","Arm B (Dacomitinib->Osimertinib)"],"otherNames":["Vizimpro"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"OS defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause, or to the date of censoring at the last time the subject was known to be alive","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years since last patient enrolled"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progresison Free Survival (PFS1)","description":"PFS1 defined the time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years since last patient enrolled"},{"measure":"Progresison Free Survival (PFS2)","description":"PFS2 defined the time from second line treatment start to disease progression or death from any cause","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years since last patient enrolled"},{"measure":"Response Rate (RR)","description":"RR defined as the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after study treatment","timeFrame":"At 1 year and 2 years"},{"measure":"Adverse Events","description":"Incidence of Adverse Events in patients treated with osimertinib followed by dacomitinib or with the opposite sequence.","timeFrame":"During the trial, untill 2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Therefore, in this study, it is hoped that sintilimab combined with anlotinib can overcome immunotherapy resistance, improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, and further improve the survival of patients, so as to provide more clinical evidence for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with negative driver gene after first-line treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody.","detailedDescription":"Most cancer cells that do not respond to a single immune checkpoint inhibitor escape through the innate immune escape mechanism, allowing them to grow and survive. Different from the inherent resistance mechanism, some patients who initially responded to immune checkpoint inhibitors developed disease progression after a period of treatment and follow-up, suggesting acquired resistance. Therefore, clinical strategies continue to be applied to overcome inherent and acquired resistance to improve the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Combining an immune checkpoint inhibitor with another drug that has both immune regulation and anti-tumor properties can enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of any one drug when used alone. Studies have shown that tumor angiogenesis participates in anti-tumor immune regulation and will aggravate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, and anti-angiogenesis therapy can normalize the abnormal vascular structure and function of tumors, and help the recruitment and infiltration of effector T cells. , Reduce the accumulation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, relieve the immunosuppressive state, thereby improving the efficacy of immunotherapy.

Furthermore, recent data suggest that during the last decade, the incidence and mortality of NSCLC has decreased in younger patients, while it has increased among older patients. Based on these observations, it becomes clear that NSCLC represents a significant health problem in elderly patients. However, elderly patients are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials evaluating new treatments in NSCLC. Indeed, more than 75% of patients older than 65 years with metastatic NSCLC never receive any kind of chemotherapy in the daily clinical practice.\n\nAccording to retrospective data,the addition of bevacizumab to a standard, platinum-based chemotherapy regimen improves overall survival in patients with advanced non-squamous-cell, non-small-cell lung cancer and a good ECOG performance status. In addition, bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival and improves response rate.\n\nIn elderly patients there is a complete lack of prospective data regarding the role of bevacizumab. It is not clear whether elderly patients gain any survival benefit or not and if the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapeutic regimens results in a significant increase in toxicity.\n\nThere is a clear need to prospectively evaluate the tolerability of bevacizumab when added to standard first-line chemotherapy of elderly NSCLC patients. Therefore, the investigators propose to study the efficacy in elderly (\\>70 years) patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in the context of 1st line treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["Metastatic NSCLC","Elderly","1st Line","Bevacizumab-based treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Doc/Bev","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Docetaxel/Bevacizumab","interventionNames":["Drug: Docetaxel","Drug: Bevacizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel","description":"Docetaxel: 60mg/m2 i.v on day 1.

Even though patients have a better response rate and longer PFS comparing to chemotherapy, drug resistance have been an inevitable issue associated with these drugs. The standard of subsequent treatment for TKI resistance at present is chemotherapy (platinum doublet chemotherapy), which shows limited benefit with ORR 20-30% and PFS nearly 4 months. Therefore, it is essential to develop the novel therapies.\n\nImmune checkpoint therapy, which is based on negative regulatory mechanisms and targeted enhancement of the anti-tumor immune response, is a novel and important therapeutic strategy for lung cancer, especially for those patients with PD-1/PD-L1 positive advanced NSCLC. VEGF signaling regulates immune suppression by promoting the expansion of suppressive immune cell populations. Therefore, modulation of VEGF-mediated immune suppression could potentially augment the immunotherapeutic activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Lenvatinib is a multitargeted TKI with anti-tumor activity via inhibiting VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-4 and PDGFR. It modulates the cancer immunity associated with a decrease in the population of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages and an increase in interferon-γ-producing CD8+ T cells. The combination of immune check point inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) and lenvatinib could be a promising strategy to improve the immunotherapy outcome in lung cancer patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["Pembrolizumab","Lenvatinib","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"This is an open-label, single-arm phase II study of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in PD-L1 positive patients with TKI-resistant EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pembrolizumab + Lenvatinib in PD-L1 Positive TKI resistant NSCLC patients","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The PD-L1 positive patients with TKI-resistant EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC will receive the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib.","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab","Drug: Lenvatinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab","description":"Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles","armGroupLabels":["Pembrolizumab + Lenvatinib in PD-L1 Positive TKI resistant NSCLC patients"],"otherNames":["Keytruda"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Lenvatinib","description":"Lenvatinib 20mg will be administered orally daily.","armGroupLabels":["Pembrolizumab + Lenvatinib in PD-L1 Positive TKI resistant NSCLC patients"],"otherNames":["Lenvima"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-free survival","description":"the time from the start of intervention to evidence of radiographic progression as defined by RECIST criteria or death from any cause without evidence of disease progression, whichever occurs first.

NSCLC patients with BM with a median overall survival (OS) of 2-3 months when treated with systemic corticosteroid alone, and a median OS of 3-6 months when treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Recently, several studies have reported the benefits of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR mutation NSCLC patients with BM. The median OS of EGFR mutation patients with BM significantly improved with TKIs treatment, which ranged from 11.8 to 18.8 months. However, for the EGFR wide-type NSCLC patients with BM, the prognosis remains poor.\n\nIt was found that the combination of anti-VEGF drugs and brain radiotherapy can not only reduce the volume of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE), reduce the intracranial pressure, relieve the symptoms of nerve compression, reduce the risk of brain hernia during brain radiotherapy, and but also inhibit the hypoxia of tumor cells, increase the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, and ultimately improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.\n\nApatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mildly inhibits c-Kit and c-SRC, has been reported to show efficacy among some patients with malignant supratentorial gliomas.\n\nTherefore, the investigators initiated this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent radiotherapy with Apatinib in patients with Brain Metastases from drive gene wide-type Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["Brain metastasis","Apatinib","Radiotherapy","NSCLC","Drive gene negative"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Apatinib combined with Radiotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Drugs: Apatinib Apatinib (500 mg/d) was given orally for one week before the brain radiotherapy, and then, continued to be administered at the same way during the brain radiotherapy period (3 weeks).

Cadonilimab, a PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Anlotinib can regulate tumor microenvironment. Docetaxel was used in standard of care chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer, work to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving cadonilimab, anlotinib and docetaxel together may work better in treating patients with non-small lung cancer compared to standard of care.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. Dose discovery stage: evaluate the safety of cadonilimab combined with anlotinib and docetaxel in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC after failure of treatment with PD-L1/1 inhibitors and the recommended dose of anlotinib.\n2. Dose expansion stage: evaluate the 6-month PFS rate of patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC after failure of treatment with PD-L1/1 inhibitors by cadonilimab combined with anlotinib and docetaxel, which was evaluated by researchers based on RECIST v1.1.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), time to response (TTR), and total survival (OS) of patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC after failure of treatment with PD-L1/1 inhibitors with cadonilimab, anlotinib, and docetaxel.\n2. evaluate the safety and tolerability of cadonilimab combined with arotinib and docetaxel in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC after failure of treatment with PD-L1/1 inhibitor.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nThis is a prospective, open, single-arm, multi-center, phase I b/II clinical study. All patients were confirmed Locally advanced (stage IIIB/IIIC) that cannot be resected by radical surgery and cannot accept radical synchronous/sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy or metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC by histology or cytology. Patients must have progressed on at most a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy (combined or sequential, regardless of sequence), and at least two cycles of PD-1/L1 inhibitor (combined or non-combined chemotherapy) with clinical benefits (PFS ≥ 3 months). The study is divided into two parts. The first part is the dose discovery stage. The patients will receive a 21-day observation period of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). 3-6 subjects will be enrolled in each dose, and finally evaluate the safety and determine the recommended dose (RP2D) for phase II clinical study according to the \"3+3\" principle. We will continue to recruit 44 patients at the dose expansion stage."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC Stage IV","NSCLC Stage IIIB","NSCLC Stage IIIC"],"keywords":["Cadonilimab","AK104","NSCLC","resistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A (cadonilimab，anlotinib，docetaxel )","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive anlotinib 6mg/8mg/10mg qd 2W/3W and cadonilimab IV over 90 minutes on day 1.

The cure rates however need to be improved. The main mechanism by which both radiation and Cisplatin kill tumor cells is by an accumulation of un- or misrepaired DNA damage.PARP inhibitors increase radiation and chemotherapy (Cisplatin) response in preclinical studies including lung cancer models.\n\nThis open label dose escalating trial consists of a screening phase, a treatment phase and a follow up phase.\n\nThe screening phase: patients who can tolerate concurrent cisplatin will receive Olaparib, RT and Cisplatin. Patients who can not tolerate concurrent cisplatin will receive Olaparib and RT with or without prior sequential chemotherapy.\n\nThe treatment phase:dose escalation of Olaparib will be performed in cohorts of 3 subjects. The decision to escalate to the next dose level will be based on the occurrence of DLTs during the DLT evaluation period (i.e. 3 months following the last day of irradiation) and will be made after all patients within the cohort have completed their third month of follow up.\n\nActive follow-up phase: frequent follow up will take place during the first 3 months (acute toxicity). Thereafter patients will be monitored for late toxicity and for disease activity 3-monthly throughout the first year and thereafter 6-monthly until 5 years, when patients are deemed to be cured and follow up is no longer warranted.\n\nOlaparib will be given orally BID for 36 consecutive days, administrated with a 12 hour interval. Olaparib will start 2 days before start of RT and will continue for 2 days after the last RT fraction.

Furthermore, recent data suggest that during the last decade, the incidence and mortality of NSCLC has decreased in younger patients, while it has increased among older patients. Based on these observations, it becomes clear that NSCLC represents a significant health problem in elderly patients. However, elderly patients are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials evaluating new treatments in NSCLC. Indeed, more than 75% of patients older than 65 years with metastatic NSCLC never receive any kind of chemotherapy in the daily clinical practice.\n\nIn elderly patients there is lack of prospective data regarding the role of platinum-based doublets. It is not clear whether elderly patients gain any survival benefit or not from platinum-based doublets and whether these chemotherapeutic regimens result in a significant increase in toxicity.\n\nThere is a clear need to prospectively evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of platinum-based doublets as first-line chemotherapy for older NSCLC patients.\n\nOn this basis it would be very interesting to initiate a phase I/II study with gemcitabine/carboplatin combination as first line treatment in older NSCLC patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["Metastatic NSCLC","Elderly","1st Line","Platinum-based treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":69,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carbo/GEM","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Gemcitabine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"Carboplatin: 2.5 AUC i.v on day 1.

In the standard regimen the cisplatinum dose is 75 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Due to the high platinum-dose patients do need a strict hyperhydration and often have to be hospitalized for survey. Split-dose cisplatinum with two administrations on Day 1 and 8 of a 21-day-cycle has already been administered in other platin-containing chemotherapy regimens (cis/gem cis/nav cis/paclitaxel cis/docetaxel) with favourable toxicity profiles and generally with an excellent patient compliance.","detailedDescription":"There is a current need to develop a split-dose cisplatinum regimen in combination with pemetrexed with high efficacy, excellent treatment compliance, administration convenience and the possibility to open up easier outpatient administration of the chemotherapy protocol. Dosing of cisplatinum at 40 mg/m2 d 1 and day 8 seems to be very effective and useful for this strategy. The current trial will address this issue within a prospective randomized phase-II trial. Treatment will be given on day 1 and 8 in the split-dose arm. A comparator arm of the current three-weekly higher cisplatinum schedule will be added to this study. For evaluation of this strategy observation of the toxicity/efficacy ratio within this trial will be of major importance.

Female patients with childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception (combined oral contraceptives, hormon-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device, hormonal contraceptive implants, hormonal contraceptive injectables) or have sexual intercourse with a vasectomised partner only during and for 6 months after the study and their pregnancy test must be negative within 7 days prior to study enrollment.\n\n      A female subject is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 2 year or unless she is surgically sterile.\n\n      Male patients must agree to use condoms during the study and for 6 months after the study if their partner is of childbearing potential and does not use highly effective method of contraception.\n  11. Estimated life expectancy of 12 weeks\n  12. Patient compliance and geographic proximity that allow adequate follow up.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n  1. Active participation in other clinical studies or treatment with any experimental drug within 30 days prior to study enrollment or during study participation.\n  2. Patients with known somatic activating mutations of EGFR, as these patients should be offered EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment as first-line therapy. Detection of EGFR mutations and additional somatic mutations with relation to treatment will be performed centrally at the Universitätsklinikum Essen. In case immediate treatment initiation is required for medical reasons (such as superior vena cava syndrome, severely symptomatic disease) patients may be enrolled before results from EGFR testing are available. As EGFR-TKI treatment is equally effective in second-line therapy, such patients may remain on study treatment if a clinical benefit is derived.\n  3. Peripheral neuropathy of ³CTCAE Grade 1\n  4. Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures\n  5. A serious concomitant systemic disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to complete the study.\n  6.

Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study enrollment\n  8. Documented brain metastases unless the patient has completed successful local therapy for central nervous system metastases and has been off of corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks before enrollment. Brain imaging is required in symptomatic patients to rule out brain metastases,but is not required in asymptomatic patients\n  9. The effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion and ascites, on pemetrexed is unknown. In patients with clinically significant third space fluid, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to pemetrexed administration.\n  10.

Today, a new frontier in the fight against cancer is immunotherapy, a treatment that aims to \"awaken\" the patient's immune system to help it recognize and attack cancer cells.\n\nAmong the various approaches, there is significant focus on therapies that activate T lymphocytes, a type of immune cell, encouraging them to react against the tumor. These treatments have led to important progress and represent a hope for the future.","detailedDescription":"Prospective study aimed at evaluating the development of anti-drug antibodies in patients with NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either as monotherapy or in combination, and the correlation between the presence of anti-drug antibodies, treatment efficacy, and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo assess whether patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors as single agent or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy develop anti-drug antibodies during the course of treatment Secondary objective: To assess whether development of anti-drug antibodies is associated with response, duration of response, PFS, OS, toxicity For each eligible patient, a blood sample (6 ml) will be collected before the start of therapy and before each treatment cycle until disease progression or the completion of the planned cycles.

However, the acquired resistance of EGFR-TKI occurs almost constantly. Anlotinib is a novel oral multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor and primary targeted to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit. The ALTER-0303 trial showed that patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received anlotinib as third-line or further therapy had more survival benefit.
