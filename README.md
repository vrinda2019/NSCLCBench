# NSCLCBench

NSCLCBench
NSCLCBench is a lightweight benchmark designed to evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems answer core evidence-based questions about Phase 3 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical trials. It focuses on four essential tasks: trial counting, primary endpoint identification, PRO/COA inclusion detection, and PRO/COA instrument extraction. The benchmark provides a simple, structured way to assess clinical-trial reasoning, retrieval quality, and hallucination control for AI systems supporting clinical research and protocol design.
